# 🚲 Bike Demand Forecasting

## Overview

This project analyzes and forecasts daily bike rental demand based on historical data. The goal is to identify key trends, seasonality, and provide actionable insights through time series modeling. The work is conducted using **R Markdown**, and results are presented in an interactive **HTML report**.

## 📊 Dataset Description

**File:** `BikeDemandDaily.csv`

This dataset includes daily observations on bike rental counts, weather conditions, and temporal data like weekday/weekend, holidays, and seasons.

### Key Variables:
- `dteday` : Date of observation
- `season` : Season (1:spring, 2:summer, 3:fall, 4:winter)
- `yr` : Year (0:2011, 1:2012)
- `mnth` : Month (1 to 12)
- `weekday` : Day of week
- `holiday` : Whether the day is a holiday
- `workingday` : Whether the day is neither weekend nor holiday
- `temp`, `atemp` : Normalized temperature and feeling temperature
- `hum` : Humidity
- `windspeed` : Wind speed
- `cnt` : Total bike rentals (target variable)

## 🧠 Methodology

The forecasting pipeline involves:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
   Handling missing values, creating time series objects, converting variables to appropriate types.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Time series decomposition  
   - Seasonal and trend analysis  
   - Correlation between weather features and demand

3. **Modeling Approaches**  
   - **ARIMA models**
   - **ETS models**
   - Comparison of multiple forecasting techniques

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - RMSE, MAPE, and visual performance checks  
   - Residual diagnostics

## 🌐 Output

The final report is available as an HTML file and can be opened in any browser:

📄 [`output/BikeDemandForecasting.html`](output/BikeDemandForecasting.html)

It includes:
- Interactive charts
- Model summaries
- Forecast plots

### Example Screenshots

## 🛠️ How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/snagori28/BikeDemandForecasting.git
   cd BikeDemandForecasting
   ```

2. Open `scripts/BikeDemandForecasting.Rmd` in **RStudio**.

3. Knit the document to generate the `output/BikeDemandForecasting.html`.

## 🔍 Insights

- Peak demand occurs during **commute hours**, especially in **spring and fall**.
- **Humidity and temperature** play a major role in affecting demand.
- Time series models effectively capture the **seasonality** and **trend** patterns in the data.
